The flow of your code is clean and well laid out. 
The class included different functions to describe a person. I think it would have been clearer, if there were docstrings (best practice), but the strptime method was used very well. This could be used to easily create a picture of a person if there are strings to describe the other variables that are passed through the function, such as for a dating app or somewhere else where physical and some personal characteristics are necessary. Overall, a good start.
